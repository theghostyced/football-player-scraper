### Project Requirement Document: Twitter Chat Bot for Sports Analytics Using SoccerData (Python Library)

---

#### 1. **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a Twitter bot that can respond to user queries about footballers' statistics and comparisons. The bot will utilize the SoccerData Python library to retrieve data, analyze it, and provide a stats breakdown of footballers in response to user requests. For example, users can tweet something like "@twitterbot compare Virgil Van Dijk with Lisandro Martinez", and the bot will reply with a detailed statistical comparison of the two players.

---

#### 2. **Objectives**

- Build a Twitter bot that can interpret specific user commands.
- Fetch relevant football data using the SoccerData Python library.
- Generate insightful statistics and comparisons of footballers.
- Respond to users on Twitter in a concise and informative manner.
- **Incorporate visual data representation** (charts or graphs) in the bot's responses for enhanced clarity.

---

#### 3. **Functional Requirements**

##### 3.1 **User Commands**

- The bot should respond to tweets that follow a specific format:
  - Example: "@twitterbot compare {Player1} with {Player2}"
  - The bot should be able to identify two players from the tweet and return their comparison.

##### 3.2 **Response Output**

- The bot should return a response that includes the following:
  - Key player stats (e.g., goals, assists, tackles, passing accuracy, etc.).
  - Comparative analysis between the two players.
  - Stats for specific leagues, competitions, or seasons (optional based on further user query).
  - A concise textual explanation of the comparison.
  - **Visual Data Representation**: The bot should generate a chart or graph visualizing the comparison (e.g., bar charts for goals, assists, etc.).

##### 3.3 **Error Handling**

- If the bot cannot find one or both players, it should respond with an appropriate message.

  - Example: "Sorry, I couldn't find stats for {PlayerName}. Please try a different player."

- If the user's command does not match the required format, the bot should prompt them with the correct format.
  - Example: "Please use the format: '@twitterbot compare {Player1} with {Player2}'."

#### 4. **Technical Requirements**

##### 4.1 **Twitter API**

- **Twitter Developer Account**: Create an account to access the Twitter API.
- **API Integration**: The bot must use the Twitter API to:
  - Listen for tweets mentioning the bot.
  - Respond to tweets with relevant information.
- **Rate Limits**: Ensure the bot adheres to Twitter's rate limits for fetching tweets and posting responses.

##### 4.2 **SoccerData Library (Python)**

- **Data Retrieval**: Use SoccerData to fetch player data from multiple sources (e.g., FIFA, transfermarkt, WhoScored, etc.).
- **Data Parsing**: The bot should parse player data into a readable format for comparison.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensure the bot fetches the most recent data available.

##### 4.3 **Bot Logic**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - Implement basic NLP or regex to parse the user’s tweet and extract player names.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Compare data between the two players.
  - Summarize the stats in a concise and readable format.

##### 4.4 **Visual Data Representation (New Feature)**

- **Chart and Graph Generation**:

  - Use a Python library (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly) to generate visual representations of the data.
  - The bot should automatically generate bar charts, pie charts, or radar charts for specific metrics like goals, assists, tackles, etc.
  - These visualizations should be included as images in the bot’s Twitter response.

- **Graph Types**:
  - **Bar Chart**: Compare the two players on metrics like goals, assists, etc.
  - **Radar Chart**: Visualize multi-dimensional data such as passing accuracy, tackles, and dribbles.
  - **Pie Chart**: Represent percentage distributions such as ball possession, successful passes, etc.

##### 4.5 **Hosting and Deployment**

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploy the bot on a cloud platform such as AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.
- **Scheduler/Listener**: Use a scheduling service or cron jobs to keep the bot listening for incoming tweets 24/7.
- **Persistence**: Implement a basic logging system to store historical requests (optional).

##### 4.6 **Security**

- **Authentication**: Use OAuth for secure interaction with the Twitter API.
- **Error Logging**: Implement error logging to catch and resolve issues in real-time.

---

#### 5. **Non-Functional Requirements**

##### 5.1 **Performance**

- **Response Time**: The bot should reply within 10-30 seconds of receiving a request, depending on data retrieval and graph generation times.
- **Scalability**: The bot should handle multiple user requests simultaneously without performance degradation.

##### 5.2 **Usability**

- The bot's responses should be easy to understand and formatted in a way that is both visually appealing and informative. The addition of charts/graphs should enhance the clarity of the comparison.

##### 5.3 **Maintainability**

- The bot code should be modular to allow for easy updates and the addition of new features (e.g., extending to other sports).

##### 5.4 **Reliability**

- Ensure the bot is online and responsive at all times.

---

#### 6. **User Stories**

- **User Story 1**: As a Twitter user, I want to compare the stats of two football players, so I can see which player has better performance metrics.
- **User Story 2**: As a Twitter user, I want to visualize the comparison of football players' stats, so I can easily interpret the data.
- **User Story 3**: As a developer, I want the bot to respond quickly and accurately, so that users get their responses in real-time.

---

#### 7. **Milestones and Timeline**

- **Week 1**: Set up Twitter Developer account and API keys. Install SoccerData library and test fetching data.
- **Week 2**: Develop the bot's core logic for processing user commands and fetching player data.
- **Week 3**: Implement response formatting, data comparison, and error handling.
- **Week 4**: Implement chart/graph generation and test the output.
- **Week 5**: Deploy the bot on a cloud platform and perform testing.
- **Week 6**: Monitor the bot’s performance and make adjustments based on user feedback.

#### 8. **Risks and Assumptions**

##### 8.1 **Risks**

- Twitter API limits may restrict the number of requests the bot can handle.
- SoccerData may have limited coverage for certain players, teams, or leagues.
- Visual data generation may introduce additional latency in response time.

##### 8.2 **Assumptions**

- Twitter users will follow the command format correctly.
- SoccerData will provide accurate and up-to-date player statistics.
- The Python libraries used for visualizations will work seamlessly with Twitter's image-handling capabilities.

---

#### 9. **Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **APIs**: Twitter API, SoccerData Python library
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (or other Python graph libraries)
- **Hosting**: AWS, Heroku, or any cloud service
- **Database**: Optional (for logging requests)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code management

---

#### 10. **Future Enhancements**

- Extend the bot to handle multiple sports (basketball, tennis, etc.).
- Add features for league-wide statistics comparisons (e.g., top 5 players in Premier League).
- Enhance visual data representation with interactive graphs or web-based visualizations.
